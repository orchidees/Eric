# Anarkid

Anarkid is an anarchist version of the Orch* tools and performs assisted orchestration.
The design principle is the Pareto rule of 80/20: we wanted to have a tool that 
is able to solve the 80% of the problem but takes the 20% of the development time.

Anarkid performs GA mono-objective optimization of MFCC and allows a very little 
number of parameters for orchestration. It does not have any external dependency.

To compile, from root folder type:

`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make`

For a more real-life tool for assisted orchestration see https://github.com/CarmineCella/liborchidea.
