# Anarkid

Anarkid is an anarchist version of Orchidea and perform assisted orchestration.
The design principle is the Pareto rule of 80/20: we wanted to have a tool that 
is able to solve the 80% of the problem but take the 20% of the development time.

Anarkid perform GA mono-objective optimization of MFCC and allows a very little 
number of parameters for orchestration.

For a more real-life tool for assisted orchestration see https://github.com/CarmineCella/liborchidea.
