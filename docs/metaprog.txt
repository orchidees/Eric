/*! \page metaprog Some (obscure) details on metaprogramming


The whole library uses some internal facilities based on template metaprogramming
(for a detailed explanation of all these techniques and much more please see
<B>A. Alexandrescu, Modern C++ Design, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2001</B>).

The most important ones are:

- policy-based design (already explained a bit in \ref policies);
- typelists;
- static check and conversions.
