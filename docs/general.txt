/*! \mainpage Intelligent assisted orchestration

Assisted orchestration can be thought as the process of searching for the best combinations of orchestral sounds to match a target sound under specified metric and constraints. Although a solution to this problem has been a long-standing request from many composers, it remains relatively unexplored because of its high complexity, requiring knowledge and understanding of both mathematical formalization and musical writing.

The <B>Orchidea</B> template library is a collection of C++ components to 
compute static and dynamic assisted orchestration.

Orchidea is an evolution of the Orch* tools; it performs mono-objective optimization on multi-dimensional features and requires a little number of parameters for orchestration.
